Example demonstrating contract execute with HBAR value transfer on the network.

This module shows how to execute a contract on the network by:
1. Setting up a client with operator credentials
2. Creating a file containing contract bytecode
3. Creating a contract using the file
4. Executing a contract payable function with HBAR value transfer

For a contract to receive HBAR (Hedera's native cryptocurrency), it must implement
one of the following:

1. receive() Function:
   A special function declared as `receive() external payable { }` that handles
   plain HBAR transfers when no specific function is called. This function:
   - Cannot have arguments
   - Cannot return anything
   - Must be declared as external and payable
   - Is executed when the contract receives HBAR without any function data

2. Payable Functions:
   Regular functions marked with the `payable` modifier that can accept HBAR
   as part of their execution. For example, the StatefulContract includes:
   `function setMessageAndPay(bytes32 _msg) external payable`

If a contract doesn't implement either of these, it cannot receive HBAR and
the transaction will fail.

Usage:
    # Due to the way the script is structured, it must be run as a module
    # from the project root directory

    # Run from the project root directory
    python -m examples.contract_execute_with_value

Note:
    The example contract (StatefulContract) implements both methods:
    - A receive() function for plain HBAR transfers
    - A setMessageAndPay() function that accepts HBAR while updating a message
