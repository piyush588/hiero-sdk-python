"""
Example demonstrating contract creation on the network.

This module shows how to create a smart contract by:
1. Setting up a client with operator credentials
2. Creating a contract using the bytecode

Usage:
    # Due to the way the script is structured, it must be run as a module
    # from the project root directory

    # Run from the project root directory
    python -m examples.contract_create_with_bytecode
