"""
This module provides utilities for loading and managing smart contract bytecode.
It contains bytecode constants for contracts and configuration constants for deployment.

File Structure:
    examples/contracts/
        ContractName/
            ContractName.sol      # Original Solidity source code
            ContractName.bin      # Compiled bytecode (hex-encoded)

Generating Bytecode Files:
    1. Use the Solidity compiler (solc) to generate hex-encoded bytecode:
       # Make sure you are in the examples/contracts directory when running this command:
       solc --bin ContractName/ContractName.sol -o ContractName/

    2. This creates a .bin file containing the contract's bytecode (no 0x prefix)

    3. Place the .bin file in the same directory as its source .sol file

Notes:
    - Bytecode files must be hex-encoded strings, not raw binaries
    - Each contract's bytecode is loaded into a constant (e.g. SIMPLE_CONTRACT_BYTECODE)
    - The _load_contract_bytecode() utility handles loading and validation
